1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure ?

In order to make sure that my code for the Contact Service project is functional and secure, I implemented JUnit tests. These tests checked to see if the different parts of the project were working correctly, for instance, in ContactServiceTest.java I wrote tests to check that contacts could be added, updated, and deleted without any issues. I made sure that the code was functional by running my JUnit tests after every change. If all of the tests passed, then I knew the code was still working. When I got feedback from my professor about the phone validation, I fixed it and then reran all of the tests to confirm I didn't break anything. When I saw that all 11 tests passed I knew the code was still functional. After writing the code, I checked test coverage and saw that Contact Service had over 85% coverage, which showed that most of the code was being tested. I also made sure the code was secure by testing for things like null values and inputs that were too long. These tests stop the program from crashing and stop bad data from getting into the system where it could cause problems.  

2. How do I interpret needs and incorporate them into a program?

3. How do I approach designing software?
